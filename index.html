        <h1>WW1: Breakout - Part 3</h1>
        <p>After uncovering the German deadly plan, Jacques knows he must deliver this information to the Allied forces. With his heart pounding, he leaves the abandoned farmhouse and heads toward the forest. The night provides him some cover, but danger lurks in every shadow.

          As he moves carefully, the distant rumble of artillery shakes the ground. Suddenly, he hears muffled voices and footsteps approaching. He quickly drops to the ground, pressing himself against the cold earth. A German patrol is nearby.

          Holding his breath, Jacques remains still. He watches as the soldiers move past him, their lanterns flickering. Once the coast is clear, he continues his journey. After an hour of cautious movement, he notices something unusual—a metal hatch partially buried under dead leaves.

          He brushes away the debris and carefully opens the heavy hatch. A hidden bunker. Could this be a secret German outpost? Or an old, abandoned refuge?

          As he steps inside, the dim light reveals maps, documents, and strange equipment scattered across the wooden table. A radio device crackles faintly. Jacques' instincts tell him this place holds valuable intelligence, but there’s no time to waste...</p>

          <h1>Jacques' Escape and a Fateful Discovery</h1>
<p>Jacques moves swiftly under the cover of darkness, navigating the ruined countryside with calculated steps. His mind races—if the Allies can decode the intelligence he carries, it could shift the tides of war. </p>

<p>But just as he nears the edge of a war-torn village, he hears distant voices—German soldiers. He freezes, pressing himself against the cold stone wall of an abandoned house. His heart pounds. He cannot risk capture.</p>

<p>Scanning his surroundings, he spots an old trench system leading toward the Allied lines. Without hesitation, he slips into the muddy passage, crawling his way forward. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and decay, remnants of past battles lingering like ghosts in the night.</p>

<p>As dawn begins to break, Jacques stumbles upon something unexpected—a satchel half-buried in the mud. Inside, he finds a collection of letters, hastily written but filled with raw emotion. Letters from soldiers and nurses, voices from both sides of the war, each carrying stories of hope, despair, and survival.</p>

<p>He tucks them into his coat and presses on. But as he nears the Allied outpost, the weight of these letters lingers in his mind. Who wrote them? What stories do they hold?</p>

<p>Now, it’s your turn to uncover their origins. Read the letters carefully and determine their country, year, and location.</p>

    <h2>🔹 Read or watch the 1918 War Briefing</h2>
  <p>1918 is the year that Woodrow Wilson unveils his 'Fourteen Points' as the basis for future world peace. Meanwhile Bolshevik Russia quits the war by signing the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, freeing up half a million German troops for General Ludendorff's last ditch attempt to win all-out victory on the Western Front. His Spring Offensive, also known as the Kaiserschlacht, or 'Kaiser's Battle', comes tantalising close to success, but is finally halted by British and Australian troops at Amiens in April. 

In the skies over the Western Front, the air war intensifies, but the Allies are now dominant. On 21st April Germany's most famous ace, Manfred von Richthofen, the 'Red Baron', is shot down and killed. 

That spring US troops arrive in Europe in force. The US 1st Infantry Division goes into action at Cantigny, while US Marines and the US 2nd Infantry Division win a victory at Belleau Wood. US troops help to turn the tide as the Allies launch their Hundred Days Offensive, surging past the Hindenburg Line, and pursuing a defeated German army. 

In the Balkans, Allied victory at Dobro Pole leads to the collapse of the Bulgarian army and an armistice. British-led forces win victory in the Middle East at Megiddo, and go on to occupy Damascus and Aleppo. With the writing on the wall, the Ottoman Empire signs an armistice with the Allies at Mudros. Austria-Hungary soon follows suit, after defeat by Italy at the Battle of Vittorio Veneto. 

Shortages, military defeat and discontent lead to revolution in Germany. Sailors at the naval base at Kiel mutiny. The Kaiser is forced to abdicate, a republic is proclaimed, and an armistice signed with the Allies at Compiègne on 11th November 1918. 

In 1919 delegates meet at Versailles, outside Paris, to conclude a peace treaty. The Treaty of Versailles imposes a 'war guilt clause' on Germany, huge war reparations, and limits the size of its armed forces. It gives territory to its neighbours, and creates lasting resentment within Germany, later exploited by Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party to foster a new German nationalism. </p>
